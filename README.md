## Introduction

<p align="center">
In Fast Adversarial Training (FAT) improve the adversarial example quality with (a) Momentum-driven initialization and (b) Max-norm regularization to enhance robustness.

> In this work, we conduct an extensive evaluation of the Momentum-Initialized Max-Norm Regularization (MIMR) method in terms of adversarial robustness and computational efficiency. We revisit the effectiveness of MIMR in mitigating Catastrophic Overfitting by leveraging momentum-driven initialization and applying max-norm regularization to stabilize model training. Additionally, we explore the impact of incorporating momentum in the initialization process and regularization, which improves the modelâ€™s resilience against adversarial perturbations while maintaining training stability. We further investigate the role of advanced weight normalization strategies and propose a novel integration of MIMR with these methods for enhanced model robustness. By combining these techniques, we introduce the MIMR-based adversarial training method, which efficiently strengthens the model's resistance to adversarial attacks. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the MIMR approach outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial training methods in terms of both adversarial accuracy and training efficiency, establishing it as a promising method for improving adversarial robustness
